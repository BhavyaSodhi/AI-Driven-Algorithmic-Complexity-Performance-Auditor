# AI-Driven-Algorithmic-Complexity-Performance-Auditor
AI-Driven Algorithmic Complexity & Performance Auditor is an intelligent system that analyzes source code and predicts its time complexity, space complexity, and potential performance bottlenecks without executing the program. It accepts Python, C++, or Java code as input, parses the structure to identify loops, recursion patterns, and data structures, and then uses machine learning to estimate computational complexity based on recognized code patterns. The system generates visual growth curves to illustrate how the algorithm scales with input size and highlights inefficiencies or bottlenecks. It also produces a detailed PDF report containing optimization suggestions and performance insights. This project is unique because it evaluates algorithmic efficiency purely through static analysis and AI prediction, works even with partial or pseudo-code, and serves as a powerful tool for education, research, and code optimization.
